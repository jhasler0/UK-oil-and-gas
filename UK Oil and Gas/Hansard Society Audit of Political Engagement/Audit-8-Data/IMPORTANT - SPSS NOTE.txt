Due to poor weather in Scotland during the main Audit survey period (3-9 December 2010), an additional set of interviews were conducted 7-13 January 2011 to boost the numbers up to representative levels for the region (197 interviews total).

There is a variable called 'week' that holds this information - the main survey was completed in week 48. The additional Scotland interviews in week 101.

To access only the main Audit survey data without the added interviews, choose the 'Select cases' option in SPSS and filter on 'week = 48'.

There is also a different set of weighting data depending on whether you are looking at the main survey data (variable = wts2), or the survey data plus the additional interviews in Scotland (variable = wts).
